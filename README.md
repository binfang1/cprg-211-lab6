This program creates an object called Event and serializes it to JSON and saves it to a file called "event.json".

Then the program reads back the data from "event.json" and deserializes it back to an Event object.

Finally, the program writes the word "Hackathon" into "event.json" and uses FileStream to seek and print the first, middle, and last characters of the string.
